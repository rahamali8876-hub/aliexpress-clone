# How We Build Software Here

## Philosophy
- Code reflects business reality
- Architecture protects teams from each other
- Simplicity beats cleverness
- Long-term thinking beats shortcuts

## Rules
1. Every feature belongs to a domain
2. Every domain has an owner
3. No shared databases
4. No bypassing APIs
5. Observability is not optional

## Decision Making
- Prefer written decisions (ADR)
- Disagree and commit
- Optimize for clarity

## Scaling
- Teams scale via autonomy
- Systems scale via events
- Architecture scales via boundaries

## Quality Bar
- If it’s hard to explain, it’s wrong
- If it can’t be observed, it’s broken
- If it breaks boundaries, it’s rejected
